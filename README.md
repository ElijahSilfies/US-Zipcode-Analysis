# Zipcode-Analysis (Work in progress)
I will be taking data found on kaggel. My objectives are to clean the data and draw reasonable conclusions about the wages in the US by looking at each zip code. 
Further objectives are to take in outside data in order to find trends and correlations between other ecenomical subjects.

Methods in use:
-Basic data cleaning
-Joining data sets
-PLoting and Graphing
-Mapping
-Linear Regression Models

Conclusions and graphics are all contained in a R notebook file called "US_Wages.nb"




**The CleanWages.csv file is an output of the R program and is the data table that was used to generate the plots in Tableau
**The StateAbrev.csv file is an input file for data cleaning convenience
**The Cost of Living.csv file is an input file to analyze the clost of living in each state compared to its average wage
